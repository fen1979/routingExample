# routingExample
Simplest route example on php language without any frameworks or libs to use routing.

In this example for connect and interact with DB i'am use the RED BEAN PHP framework, but this is only my choice, 
this example can be used in any DB or storage place 
how to connect and use DB you need to know by it self,

You can improve this code, feel free to use, change, and all what you need :)
